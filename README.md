# Actively controlled cardiac afterload simulation

Simulation of a programmable, actively controlled cardiac afterload for _ex vivo_ working mode heart evaluation. The data and methods presented here were used to generate the results presented in the article "Actively controlled cardiac afterload", presented at the IFAC World Congress 2023 in Yokohama, Japan.

## Getting started

1. Download [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
2. Open Julia REPL, e.g. using [vscode](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) (recommended) or using the command `julia` in terminal from within the repository directory.
3. Activate the working environment and download the dependencies using the following commands:

```julia
] activate .
instantiate
```
4. Open and run the simulation file `src/controlled_cardiac_afterload.jl`
